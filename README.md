# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a **user-based collaborative filtering** recommendation system using the [MovieLens 100K dataset] from kaggle

## Project Description
- Dataset: MovieLens 100K  
- Build a system that recommends movies based on **user similarity**  
- Use a **user-item rating matrix** to compute similarity scores  
- Recommend **top-rated unseen movies** for each user  
- Evaluate performance using **Precision@K**  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Scikit-learn  

## Covered Topics
- Recommendation systems  
- Similarity-based modeling  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the code.
2. Download the dataset from [Kaggle].
3. Open the provided Colab notebook and upload the dataset files (`u.data` and `u.item`).
4. Run the notebook cells step by step to:
   - Build the user-item matrix  
   - Compute user similarity  
   - Generate top recommendations  
   - Evaluate using Precision@K
